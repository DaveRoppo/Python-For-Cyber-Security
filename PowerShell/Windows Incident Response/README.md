## Automating Windows Incident Response Playbook
This PowerShell script is designed to automate early actions of the Identification phase of incident response for Windows systems. It facilitates quick and organized data collection for effective analysis. Upon execution, the script automatically creates a root directory along with subfolders that store outputs from various system commands. These outputs include general computer information, relevant event logs, user account details, running processes and services, network activities, firewall status, and any changes in registry settings. The script is, of course, not all-inclusive. However, it is meant to automate the collection of relevant data and serve as a starting point from which one can pivot from for further analysis.
