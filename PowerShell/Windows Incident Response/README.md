# About

## Automating Windows Incident Response Playbook
This PowerShell script is designed to automate early actions taken during the Identification
						Phase of the
						Incident Response Lifecycle for Windows systems. It facilitates quick and organized data
						collection for
						effective analysis. Upon execution, the script creates a root directory along with
						subfolders that store text files containing outputs from various system commands. These outputs
						include general
						computer information, user account details, running processes and services,
						network activities, firewall status,startup programs, and scheduled taks. The script is, of
						course, not all-inclusive. However, it is meant to automate the collection of relevant data and
						serve as a starting point from which one can pivot for further analysis.
